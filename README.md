20/20 Life Count Android app
============================

This repository contains the source code for the 20/20 Life Count Android
application. The application can be found from 
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.minu.lifecount2020.app">Android market</a>.
There is also an <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/20-20-life-count/id649385525">iOS</a> version available.

To see the app in action, go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGwvA-BCxLs">YouTube</a>.

Multiplayer functionality is on the works, but there is no set schedule.

This software is open source, for anyone brave enough to go through the code. I started this project as a way to
learn and keep in touch with Android development, so the code is at this date in need of major refactoring.

Happy gaming!
